# Food-Industry-Analysis
This project is built around the inadequate awareness and contextualisation within the masses towards the scale of how much major players in this industry have grown in a short space of time, as well as the emerging dependency of the population on these companies which may as well be a disadvantage in the long run.

Includes ML model building using an array of individual as well as ensemble algorithms to create a predictive User Rating System for companies in this space, in tandem with RNN 
(LSTM) modelling for Sentimental Analysis of text-based product/service reviews.

Within this repository you may find the python code file with the entire scope of the analysis along with a PowerPoint presentation to walk you through the details of the project
